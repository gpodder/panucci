                   Panucci - An audiobook and podcast player
                   -----------------------------------------

With Panucci, you can play audio books, podcasts and live concerts. It will
automatically resume the playback from the position where you stopped last
time. Bookmarks are also supported. The interface has elements big enough to be
used with your fingers. If you installed support for screen rotation, Panucci
does support portrait mode in addition to landscape mode.
