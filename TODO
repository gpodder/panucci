Some ideas/TODOs:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fullscreen support

- (Option:) Auto-unmute when headphone plugged in;
            mute when headphone unplugged, but only
            when it has been muted before (tricky?)

- support for opening m3u files and queuing the list 
	For playing audiobooks that are in many small mp3 files.
