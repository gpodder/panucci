Some ideas/TODOs:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Do not hide the volumebar when muted/volume=0. This way, the user always
  "sees" that the volume is muted, and so is not confused when he does not
  hear anything although panucci is currently playing.

- Optionally have the album art as window icon if this is possible (to show
  the album art in the task switcher, etc..)

- Read the gPodder DB if gPodder is installed and show a list of downloaded
  podcasts that the user can listen to directly from panucci (this way, users
  can download episodes with gpodder, close it and listen to all these episodes
  from within panucci - maybe deletion should also be supported)
    -> probably needs a bit more support from gpodder

- Fullscreen support

- (Option:) Auto-unmute when headphone plugged in;
            mute when headphone unplugged, but only
            when it has been muted before (tricky?)

- support for Mp3Wrap'd files, it's a handy format for putting many individual
	mp3 files into one large file without losing id3tags
